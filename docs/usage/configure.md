# Configure the import

This page contains instructions on how to configure your Spectre import.

When you start an import you'll be presented with a list of options. Some may be set already because you've used a configuration file.

## Spectre options

### Accounts

Select the accounts you want to import from. For some accounts, Firefly III will force a mapping. Others, you can pick yourself.

## Import options

### Date range.

Select the date range to import from Spectre. Duplicate transactions (transactions that have been imported earlier) will not be imported. 

### Rules

Select this if you want Firefly III to apply your rules to the import. This may slow down the import.

### Map data

Allows you to [map data](./map.md) after the transactions have been downloaded.

## Other options

If you want to, check the "skip form" button so you don't have to go through these options each time you start an import.
